# Fragment
Basic example illustrating the use of fragments

## Static fragment
The static fragmet is called from the xml current activity file.  In our example, the main_activity.xml calls the fragment by the tag <fragment>
which will instantiate the BlankFragment class

## Dynamic fragment
The dynamic fragment is called from the activity.java file and managed by the FragmentManager which will interact dynamically with the current xml activity file.
